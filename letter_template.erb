Ho ho ho <%= recipient_name %>,

how have you been? Listen, I don't think I can make it to Augsburg this year. I was hoping you could help me out.

Can you get <%= target_name %> a Christmas present? Doesn't have to be something big. It's the thought that counts, <%= recipient_name %> dear.


You would really help me out, <%= recipient_gender == 'm' ? 'brother' : 'sister' %>!

Until soon,
bis bald,
tot ziens,
Santana
