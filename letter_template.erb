Ho ho ho <%= recipient_name %>,

long time no see! How are you?

<%= recipient_gender == 'm' ? 'Brother' : 'Sister' %>, can you do me a favour? I heard that you and yours are convening in the Sauerland this year. Honestly, I am not even sure where that is and I probably won't be able to fit it in.

Can you pack a gift for <%= target_name %>? Doesn't have to be big. It's the thought that counts. Keep it simple. Or if you want to do elaborate origami, OK, be my guest!


I would really appreciate it, and I am sure <%= target_name %> would, too.

Until soon,
tot ziens,
bis bald,
Santa
